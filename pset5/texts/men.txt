It's Raining Men 
by The Weather Girls 


Hi - Hi! We're your Weather Girls - Ah-huh - 
And have we got news for you - You better listen! 
Get ready, all you lonely girls 
and leave those umbrellas at home. - Alright! - 

Humidity is rising - Barometer's getting low 
According to all sources, the street's the place to go 
Cause tonight for the first time 
Just about half-past ten 
For the first time in history 
It's gonna start raining men. 

It's Raining Men! Hallelujah! - It's Raining Men! Amen! 
I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get 
Absolutely soaking wet! 
It's Raining Men! Hallelujah! 
It's Raining Men! Every Specimen! 
Tall, blonde, dark and lean 
Rough and tough and strong and mean 

God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too 
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do 
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky 
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy 
It's Raining Men! Hallelujah! - It's Raining Men! Amen! 
It's Raining Men! Hallelujah! 
It's Raining Men! Amennnn! 

I feel stormy weather / Moving in about to begin 
Hear the thunder / Don't you lose your head 
Rip off the roof and stay in bed 

God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too 
She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do 
She taught every angel to rearrange the sky 
So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy 
It's Raining Men! Yeah! 

Humidity is rising - Barometer's getting low 
According to all sources, the street's the place to go 
Cause tonight for the first time 
Just about half-past ten 
For the first time in history 
It's gonna start raining men. 

It's Raining Men! Hallelujah! - It's Raining Men! Amen! 
It's Raining Men! Hallelujah! - It's Raining Men!
