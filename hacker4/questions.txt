- When a file that has been compressed can be decoded back into its original
  form with zero loss of information, the compression is said to be a Lossless Compression.

- If, after compression, the original file cannot be brought back again
  (like humpty dumpty), then the compression is said to be Lossy.

When the operating system erases a FAT file, two things occur.
First, the system modifies the filename’s first character in
the file’s directory entry to signal that the file has been
deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
Second, the system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters
to the hard drive’s list of free clusters. The actual file
data is never touched.

- Physically destroying the drive, rendering it unusable.
- Degaussing the drive to randomize the magnetic domains—most
  likely rendering the drive unusable in the process.
- Overwriting the drive’s data so that it cannot be recovered.

A header file containe new types definition which is:

Exact-width integer types,
Least-width integer types,
Fastest integer integer types,
Pointer integer types,
Maximum-width integer types.

It is especially useful in embedded environments where hardware usually
supports only several types and that support varies between different environments.

In our situation we use those types because we need exactly 8 bits to hold our information from BMP files.

8.  1, 4, 4, 2.
9.  BM or 0100001001001101 or 424d

bfSize: The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
biSize: The number of bytes required by the structure.

11. The bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
12. biBitCount.
13.

Because it is try to make new file named it by value contained by `outfile`
variable and if there is a file in this dirictory with same name it return NULL.

14. Because we need to read only 1 time using `RGBTRIPLE` struct size.

16. Skip the current padding if exist and set the position of the indicator after it.
17. To select the current position of the indicator.
