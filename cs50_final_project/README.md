`iMarker` it is very simple service allow you to make markers on your private map after signup and save them for years xD and you can share any of these markers individually or you can share your map to other people and tell them where you live, go, work or where is branches of your company!

`iMarker` indicate your location based on your IP Address, so if you use vpn or anything like this the map will open above your vpn IP Address.
